# Python Version

To get the Python version using Python, you can use the ```sys``` module which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.

```python
>>> import sys
```

Here's an example of how you can get the Python version using Python:

```python
>>> sys.version_info
sys.version_info(major=3, minor=11, micro=2, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
```

```python
>>> sys.version_info.major
3
```
