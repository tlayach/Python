# Exit

In Python, the ```exit()``` function is a built-in function that allows you to terminate a Python script or program immediately.

When the ```exit()``` function is called, the program stops executing and exits with a specified status code. If you don't provide a status code, the default status code is zero, which indicates successful termination.

Here's an example of how to use the exit() function:

```python
>>> exit(0)
```

When the ```sys.exit(1)``` line is executed, the program will immediately terminate with a status code of 1.

```python
>>> exit(1)
```
