# Comments

In Python, comments are used to add explanatory notes to the code that are ignored by the interpreter or compiler. They are helpful in making the code more readable and understandable for humans who read it. Comments can also be used to temporarily disable a piece of code during testing or debugging.

Python supports two types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.

Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (#) and continue until the end of the line. For example:

```python
>>> # this is a single-line comment
```

Multi-line comments, also known as block comments, start and end with triple quotes (""" or ''') and can span multiple lines. For example:

```python
>>> """
This is a multiple line
comment.
"""
'\nThis is a multiple line\ncomment.\n'
```

Another example:

```python
>>> # prints hello world
>>> print("Hello World")  # this is a single-line comment
Hello World
```
