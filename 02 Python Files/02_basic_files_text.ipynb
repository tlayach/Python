      "guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the\n",

      "more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's\n",
      "slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable\n",
      "Mock Turtle.\n",

      "rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the\n",
      "reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-\n",
      "bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd\n",
      "boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and\n",

      "still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place\n",
